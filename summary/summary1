Command to update the hostfile to github : git push origin master

All right!
This is a course of pushing code(or somethingelse) to github.
Now let´s start!

Step 1.Install Git
Start your terminal and input the command like this:

sudo apt-get install git git-core git-gui git-doc git-svn git-cvs gitweb gitk git-email git-daemon-run git-el git-arch

Then check the SSH
Input:
ssh -T git@github.com

If you can see

    Warning: Permanently added ‘github.com,204.232.175.90’ (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    Permission denied (publickey).


that means you are able to connect to the github now!

Step 2.Install SSH keys

1.Check your system whether there exist ssh keys or not. If existed, go to 2. else go to 3.
Start your terminal
COMMAND:

cd ~/.ssh
ls

if there exist id_rsa and id_rsa.pub("id_rsa" represents for private key while" id_rsa.pub" represents for public key) 
 Then you shou go to the 2.

2.copy and remove the existed ssh keys

COMMANDS:
mkdir key_backup
cp id_rsa* key_backup
rm id_rsa*

3.Execute the Command as follow

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your github email address"


4.Add the ssh keys to github
(1) use gedit/cat to check the id_rsa.pub(public key).
(2) Go to the https://github.com and go to the "Setting"->"SSH Keys"->"Add SSH Key" and stay.
(3)copy the content of the file "id_rsa.pub" to the website.


5.Double check the situation of SSH

COMMAND:

ssh -T git@github.com

if you see the follow contents, that means you add the ssh key successfully.

Hi "Your github name" ! You’ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Step 3. Starting using github

1.Config git

git config --global user.name "Your github name"
git config --global user.email "Your github email"


2.Push your code to github in a new Repository

(1)Make a directory
(2)Go to the directory you just made and initialize it
COMMAND:

cd ~/Document/Test(The directory I use is "Test")
git init

(3)Make a change to you directory
For instant, I add a Readme file here
COMMAND:
touch Readme

(4)Update 
COMMAND:
git add Readme
git commit -m 'add readme file'

(5)Push
In this part, you need to connect you local directory to the Repository
COMMAND:
git remote add origin https://github.com/"Your github Name"/"Your github Reposity".git 
git push origin master

#In the git push origin master, you might need to enter your account and password.

Step 5.How to push local file to the exiting Repository in the github
(1)clone the Repository from github
COMMAND:
git clone https://github.com/"Your github Name"/"Your github Reposity".git
(2)Make some changes to the Reposity
COMMAND:
touch Readme_new
(3)Update it
COMMAND:
git add Readme_new
git commit -m 'add new readme file'
(4)Push
git remote add origin https://github.com/"Your github Name"/"Your github Reposity".git
git pull origin master

#Sometime after you put in command "git remote add origin https://github.com/"Your github Name"/"Your github Reposity".git". You will get a result "fatal: remote origin already exists". Then you just need to enter the Command "git remote rm origin", which will help you solve this problem.
